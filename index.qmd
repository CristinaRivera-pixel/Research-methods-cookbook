# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is my cookbook for my Advanced Research Methods Class with Dr. Abdi. The purpose of this book is to have a reference for all the Advanced Research Methods I have learned in this class and give an overview of each method and an interpretation of the findings using each method. This is for my future self, or anybody who find this.
